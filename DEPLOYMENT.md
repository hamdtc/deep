Deployment

I completed the above steps, I can deploy the service. Here are the steps for deployment:

Setting up a server to run Apache Storm and your chosen backend (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB). Cloning the repository containing your code onto the server. Installed all the required dependencies (Apache Storm, Selenium, etc.). Settted up your backend (create the required tables, set up authentication, etc.). Runnned the stormcrawler command to start crawling the seed URLs. Monitored the logs to ensure that the crawling process is running smoothly. Once the crawling process is complete, extracted the data from the database and create the result JSON file. Made the result JSON file accessible to the user.

Step 2: Key Takeaway

One key takeaway from this exercise is the importance of using a distributed system like Apache Storm to handle large-scale web crawling. Apache Storm allows us to distribute the crawling process across multiple nodes, making it faster and more efficient. Additionally, the use of Selenium allows for the extraction of full-page screenshots, which can be useful for certain applications. Overall, this exercise demonstrates the power and potential of distributed systems and web crawling for data acquisition and analysis.
